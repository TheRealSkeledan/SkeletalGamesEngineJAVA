# Skeletal Games Engine (JAVA EDITION)
The Java version of Skeletal Games Engine, designed to give a good start to people who want to make a Java-based game

## Why choose?
* This Engine is not from a typical engine, such as Unity or Unreal. Instead, it is pre-coded to help users use the engine as a template
* It is also coded to be efficient, with the current max framerate being around 300 FPS. Future releases will include refined ways to increase the cap
* Includes a Java compiler along with it to compile the source code into a runnable EXE. Currently will only compile for Windows
* It is planned that in the future, there'll will be more customisation options and pre-coded varities, such as loading screens, menus, and more!
* You're not limited to anything! You can code everything in Java and change whatever you need for better development

## What games can I make?
* You can make various 2D games, such as RPGs or fighter games
* The base games currently is a basic fighting game

## Is Java the only language I can use?
There are plans in the future where Skeletal Games Engine will be transfered to Haxe and C++.

A Python version is already in development.

## Planned Future Updates
* A logo
* Java compiler
* Side-scrolling
* Enemies
